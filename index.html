<h1>About</h1>
<p>During my time enrolled in Georgia Tech's UX/UI bootcamp, we were given the challenge of creating an app that helped users book their travel needs quickly and easily.
    This project was done individually on a two week deadline. Research and design were to be completed in a timely manner.
</p>


<div class="problem-solution">
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Users need a way to book their vacations stress free because of the day to day stress of work, family, and other factors in order to relax and spend quality time with their families.
</p>
<h1> Solution</h1>
<p>Travaldi hopes to streamline the booking process for users using user research while implementing accessibility options and new features that users wish to see in a travel app.

<section class="interviews">
    <h2>Interviews</h2>
    <p>During the ideation phase of the project, user interviews and a survey were conducted to gain a better understanding of the pain points of users during their current booking process. An interview plan and script were written that consisted of 9 open ended questions, focusing on the problem that was trying to be solved. I wanted to answer the following questions:</p>
    <li>How would you describe your current travel booking process?</li>
    <li>Could you describe the best travel booking experience?</li>
    <li>Could you describe the worst travel booking experience?</li>
    <p>Over a 3 day period, 43 survey responses and 5 interviews were collected. With the data gathered, the design and functionality of the app mirrored the findings.</p>
</section>

<section class="user-path">
    <h2>User Journey & Path</h2>
    <p>After analyzing the research data, it was found that users often had to jump through hoops in order to book a simple vacation and often had to visit several different sites. It appeared that there was no single site or app that was a "one stop shop" for booking vacations. Mapping out a user's journey allowed me to find potential snags that a user may face. A journey from search to checkout was mapped in order to analyze the average user's path. It was found that it could be possible that users could not locate their booking confirmations and would need to contact customer service.

<section class="wireframes">
    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>Using Figma, I translated my first sketches into low-fidelity wireframes. Then, I improved them by adding a few relevant stock images and copies provided by the marketing team. At this stage, the wireframes were defined enough for some user testing. Based on 4 tests, I’ve made a few alternations and moved on to creating high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
